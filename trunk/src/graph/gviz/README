Use Grappa with a '.dot' suffix file.

Both Demos lack layout although Grappa uses a call to
the GraphViz executable 'dot' to do autolayout.

Grappa extremely slow on X-Connection, JGraphT far
superior for redrawing, etc... here.  Need to
investigate how these perform on local machines.

Also, any hope of a Windows script for Grappa 
formatting?
